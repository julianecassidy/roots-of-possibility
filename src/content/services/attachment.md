Attachment disruptions in children and youth can manifest in various emotional, behavioral, and social challenges. These disruptions often lead to difficulties in forming secure relationships, resulting in trust issues, anxiety, and an increased fear of abandonment. Your child may exhibit clinginess, withdrawal, or aggression as they struggle to navigate their emotions and interactions with others. Academic performance can also be affected, as the lack of a stable attachment can hinder focus and motivation. Additionally, attachment disruptions can lead to poor self-esteem and difficulty in regulating emotions, making it challenging for children and youth to cope with stress and build healthy, supportive relationships throughout their development.

We utilize evidence-based techniques to address issues stemming from early attachment disruptions, promoting emotional healing and resilience.
