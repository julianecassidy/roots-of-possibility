Your early adult years are an exciting time filled with changes and growth. Therapy can help support you through these changes. Roots of Possibility offers an individualized approach to therapy for clients between 19 and 30 years old.

## What to Expect

The therapy process starts by building a relationship between the clinician (me) and the client (you!). I firmly believe in the importance of getting to know someone as a person in order to best be able to support them – that means not just learning about your struggles, but also your successes, your interests, passions, and  hobbies.

Once trust has been established, then we dive into “the work.” We’ll start by exploring the history or backstory of whatever is bringing you to my office, and then we’ll set goals together to work towards as a team, breaking everything down step-by-step to make changes in your life.

## Therapy for Special Populations
