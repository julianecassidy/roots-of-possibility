Childhood trauma can present immense challenges for both the individual and their caregivers, whether manifesting as behavioral changes, dramatic shifts in mood, or over-reliance on unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance use or self-harm. Sometimes, depending on the age at which trauma took place, we may not even be aware of the underlying experiences influencing and shaping our understanding of, and approach to, the world.

Our trauma therapy services are designed to provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals navigating the complexities of trauma recovery. With a focus on evidence-based modalities tailored to your unique needs, we offer a range of therapeutic approaches, including somatic experiencing, narrative therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and more. At Roots of Possibility, we understand that healing from trauma is a deeply personal journey, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

For children and youth with attachment trauma in particular, animal-assisted interventions with canine co-therapist Dottie Lou may provide particular benefits, including co-regulation – the process by which the presence and interaction with an animal help a person regulate their emotional and physiological state.

Take the first step towards reclaiming your resilience and well-being by [scheduling a consultation](https://rootsofpossibility.com/contact) today.

### EMDR
RoP does not offer EMDR at this time, and yet we still specialize in helping people – particularly youth – who have experienced trauma. Contrary to popular media depictions, EMDR is not synonymous with trauma therapy – because no approach is one-size-fits-all.

Despite its widespread recognition, popularity, and success in many cases in the mental health space, EMDR is not the best fit for everyone with a trauma history, and it’s RoP’s belief that it should not be the first-course treatment option for younger people.

At its core, trauma therapy necessitates a delicate balance between evidence-based methodologies and the unique dynamics of each client's experience. While EMDR has demonstrated efficacy for some individuals, EMDR does not always align with the fluid, client-centered approach we strive to cultivate.

RoP is committed to holistic care. Trauma manifests in multifaceted ways, and a comprehensive treatment plan may require a range of therapeutic interventions tailored to the individual's needs. By forgoing EMDR, RoP is able to dedicate resources to exploring other complementary modalities, enriching the therapeutic toolkit available to clients.
