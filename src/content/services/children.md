While accounting for individual preferences and developmental appropriateness, I love to incorporate art and other creative activities to keep younger kids engaged and drive self-reflection while building emotional vocabulary. I also integrate bibliotherapy - where your child and I can learn and expand on skills via storytelling and imagination.

### Process
1. Initial consultation and intake session

The first time we meet for therapy, in order to get the best possible “whole picture” of a child, I always ask to meet with both the client and a guardian, together. This helps me to better understand your family dynamics, and get input from both parent and child perspectives before I formulate a treatment plan.

2. Therapy sessions

For the majority of the therapeutic process, your child and I will meet (virtually) one on one. An adult always needs to be present in the home in case of emergency, however, the relationship between clinician and client will be most authentic if parents are not in the same room (although there are of course exceptions to this, and everything is decided on a case-by-case, revisitable basis).

3. Periodic parent involvement

From time to time, I will ask guardians to join the child client and I for a session (in whole or in part), particularly if there are specific issues that need to be addressed such as communication. As the parent/guardian, you are also always welcome to bring things to my attention, either confidentially or as a “team,” that you feel are important for me to know or that need to be attended to.
