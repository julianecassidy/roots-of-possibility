                Animal assisted therapy box text: Dorothy Elouise, or Dottie Lou
                for short, is a rescued mutt from the streets of rural Texas.
                Prior to being adopted, she was quite ill and subject to unknown
                traumas; however, her loving and socially-motivated nature has
                shown through since day one. She is a registered therapy dog
                through Professional Therapy Dogs of Colorado, having passed
                their behavioral evaluation in July 2023.
